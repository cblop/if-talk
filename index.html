## Building Interactive Stories with Tropes

# Generative vs Interactive Narratives

## Generative Narratives

## Interactive Narratives

layout: false

## Why not both?

- Generative elements save authors time and drudgery
- However, pre-written branches give the author total control
- Is there some way we can get the best of both worlds?

---

## Planners: the dominant (academic) approach

Majority of academic research involves:

- Intelligent Agents as characters
- Planners to "direct" the agents

This is nice, but:

- The author must still write lots of goals for the agent and the story
- The characters have no agency!

<!-- (diagram?) -->

---
## Our crazy idea: Social Norms

- If intelligent agents are the characters in a simulated world, what is the story?
- Need something abstract, invisible, that gently "guides" the characters

How about social norms?

- They invisibly govern our behaviour in the real world, why not in a story?

# How do we describe stories as social norms?!

We need a way to model story components!

## Propp's story functions

31 story functions, including:

- **Absentation**: One of the members of a family absents himself from home.
- **Interdiction**: An interdiction is addressed to the hero.
- **Complicity**: The victim submits to deception and thereby unwittingly helps his enemy.
- **Villainy**: The villain causes harm or injury to a member of the family.

# Tropes!

## Tropes?

- Multiple levels of abstraction
- A trope can describe a whole story, a scene or just a character or line of dialogue
- Can be endlessly combined for plenty of rich possibilities
- TVTropes ([tvtropes.org](http://tvtropes.org)) is the Wikipedia of tropes, with a very active community
- [The Periodic Table of Storytelling](http://www.designthroughstorytelling.net/periodic/) is one way of organising/visualising tropes

---
### Trope examples

**The Hero's Journey**: A hero answers a call to adventure, and leaves home to go on a journey. They defeat the villain along the way, returning back home triumphant.

**The Evil Empire**: The villain is part of an empire, which tries to stop the hero at all costs.

**The MacGuffin**: There's some object that the hero is after, but which the audience doesn't really care about

**Chekhov's Gun**: If a gun appears somewhere in the first act, it must be fired by the end of the third.

### Tropes that even a computer can understand

Break them down into three things:

- characters (**roles**)
- objects (**types**)
- places (**locations**)

Describe their interactions with (deontic) logic:

- permissions: a character **may** go to the cinema
- obligations: a character **must** study before the exam, otherwise they will fail

---

## Examples

*The Hero's Journey*: The hero **must** leave home when they receive the call to adventure. Then the hero **may** kill the villain. Once this is done, the hero **may** return home.

*The Evil Empire*: The villain has an empire, and **may** kill the hero.

*MacGuffin*: The hero **must** search for an object. However, the hero **may** find it.

# The Nasty Details

How all this is actually coded

---
layout: false

## Answer Set Programming

Loads of tropes can be active at once, so how do we work out what permissions/obligations the characters have?

- We use **Answer Set Programming** (logic programming, like Prolog) to describe the story
- Then we tell it what events have happened so far in the story
- Then we use a **solver** to work out what can happen next

---

## We made a language! We called it TropICAL!

- TropICAL: the TROPe Interactive Chronical Action Language
- Inform 7-inspired syntax
- Compiles to InstAL (a language for deontic logic), which compiles to AnsProlog (ASP)
- Double the compilation, double the fun!
- (I'll show you some examples)

---

## StoryBuilder

StoryBuilder is a tool that makes it simple for authors to:

- **Create** and edit their own tropes
- **Arrange** tropes to form a story
- **Play** the resulting story
- **Share** the story with their friends

There's still work to be done, as you'll see in my demo!

---

## Summary of our approach:

- **Intelligent Agents** to model characters (beliefs, desires, intentions)
- **Social Norms** to govern the characters in a narrative
- **Tropes** to describe the social norms
- Fancy logic programming (**Answer Set Programming**) to work out what norms/tropes hold at any given point in the story

Authors spend less time writing, characters have some autonomy

---

## The missing pieces

Plenty of work to be done on StoryBuilder:

- Need a way of creating characters, their dialogue and goals
- Then hooking it up to a Multi Agent System
- Also a way to describe objects and places, and their characteristics
- Populate the DB with pre-written tropes
- Share it with the TVTropes community to get more tropes
